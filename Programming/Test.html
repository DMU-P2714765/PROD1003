    <p>I'm a Leicestershire-based independent photographer, and I've been progressively taking up an interest in this form of media for a long while now, ever since I completed an assignment for it in the November of the first year in my time at university. I found during the work I carried out for said assignment that outdoor-based environment and scenery photography, specifically, was a great deal of fun for me to then begin my own projects on, not just due to the fact of having such a large amount of creativity in your hands for how you afterwards enhance the pictures you've taken, but in addition, walking around to all the locations you want to snap some photos of - just yourself and wherever you wish to go, and the history and characteristics you learn about those places in the process.</p>

    <p>To see my still ongoing collection of photography works, just slide along onto the next page on from this one, the Portfolio, and there they'll all be waiting for you! Be sure, as well, to click on the pictures there if you'd like to also see their specifications, which are the camera settings used to take them and the date on which they were captured in the first place.</p>
