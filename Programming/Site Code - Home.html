        <!--This video was created all the way back in October, as a nature-related group exercise for another assignment, so I decided to make use of it as I still had the file in my drive.
        I compressed this file down to under 25MB so that Github would accept it when I published my Beta version of the site, and I did the same for the OGG file, which was included to ensure that 
        everyone would be able to view the video regardless of the precise nature of the device they're doing so on.
    I've provided an image to be displayed before the video plays, for more decorative purposes, and I've additionally included a fallback in the form of the download link within the Paragraph text
property in the event that the user's browser doesn't support the video.-->

    <p style="font-size: 22px" align="justify">I'm a Leicestershire-based independent photographer, and I've been progressively taking up an interest in this form of media for a long while now, ever since I completed an assignment for it in the November of the first year in my time at university. I found during the work I carried out for said assignment that outdoor-based environment and scenery photography, specifically, was a great deal of fun for me to then begin my own projects on, not just due to the fact of having such a large amount of creativity in your hands for how you afterwards enhance the pictures you've taken, but in addition, walking around to all the locations you want to snap some photos of - just yourself and wherever you wish to go, and the history and characteristics you learn about those places in the process.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 22px" align="justify">To see my still ongoing collection of photography works, just slide along onto the next page on from this one, the Portfolio, and there they'll all be waiting for you!</p>
    <!--A large majority of this summary text to start off with was copied and pasted from that of the original Interface Design concept, to which I wanted a very similar simple but sleek font.-->

        They don't function as actual hyperlinks to interact with and are instead purely decorational, though if they were to be hyperlinks I could've used the a href attribute like with the navigation bar.-->
